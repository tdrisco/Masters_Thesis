# Masters Thesis Project
Working on the design and development of a self-contained motion tracking system optimized for human gait. This project involves creating a special filter to use the information from a low-cost nine degrees of freedom (9DoF) inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor in combination with mathematical models to accurately track the motion of a human leg throughout the gait cycle. This project aims to create a novel system that provides motion tracking information to lengthen and shorten a full leg prosthesis as it moves throughout the gait cycle.
